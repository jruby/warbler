== 0.9

* Birthday! Warbler is a gem to make a .war file out of a Rails project. The intent is to provide a
  minimal, flexible, ruby-like way to bundle up all of your application files for deployment to a
  Java application server.
* Bundled versions: goldspike-1.4-SNAPSHOT and jruby-complete-1.0.1
* Works as both a gem (rake application) or a plugin
