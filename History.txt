== 1.3.0

- Warbler can now package regular Ruby projects as executable jar
  files. See the README.txt file for details.
- WARBLER-18: Heed BUNDLE_GEMFILE in environment

== 1.2.1

- Add --directoryListings=false to Winstone launch by default. In some
  cases (sinatra) Winstone's directory listing masks application
  content. (Fletcher Nichol)
- Build and add META-INF/init.rb file into the war file. This is
  recognized and loaded by JRuby-Rack 1.0.3 as a new way to do extra
  environment initialization before the web framework is loaded. See
  config.init_contents in Warbler::Config for details.

== 1.2.0

- Drop compatibility with earlier versions of Bundler -- Bundler has
  changed a lot in a short period of time, so I'm expecting the number
  of people depending on 0.8 or 0.9 to be small. Please use Warbler
  1.2.0 with applications that depend on Bundler 1.0 or higher.
- Support for Bundler groups. The 'development' and 'test' groups are
  excluded by default.
- Add 'compiled' feature: With this feature added to config.features
  Warbler will pre-compile all Ruby files and will not ship the
  original Ruby source in your war file.
- warble.rb: Add config.bundle_without that controls Bundler groups to
  be skipped, like 'Bundler.settings.without'.
- warble.rb: Add config.compiled_ruby_files to specify which Ruby
  files to compile when using the "compiled" feature. Defaults to
  compiling all Ruby files.
- warble.rb: Add config.gem_excludes which allows exclusion of some
  gem files from the war. Default assumes no exclusions.
- Exclude 'tmp/war' directory so that people upgrading from 0.9 won't
  accidentally include it in their war file.

== 1.1.0

- Add concept of "features" -- small Rake tasks that run before the
  creation of the war file and make manipulations to the war file
  structure.
- Add 'gemjar' feature: Bundle all gems into a gems.jar to reduce the
  number of files in the archive (mostly useful for Google AppEngine).
  Usage: run "warble gemjar war" or set config.features = %w(gemjar) in
  warble.rb to use this feature.
- Add 'executable' feature: Bundle an embedded web server in the war
  file so that the entire application can be run as
  'java -jar myapp.war'.
  Usage: run "warble executable war" or set config.features = %w(executable)
  in warble.rb to use this feature.
  To see embedded webserver options, add '--help' to the 'java -jar'
  command line.
- No longer embed config.ru in web.xml as 'rackup' parameter by
  default. Instead, config.ru is included in the war file.
- Bump jruby-rack version requirement to 0.9.8.

== 1.0.3

- Tracking recent Bundler changes - handle locked Gemfiles differently
  than unlocked ones
- Handle file-based symlinks, and warn about inoperational directory
  symlinks under non-JRuby versions of Ruby.

== 1.0.2

- Add 'warble pluginize' task back. This task now just creates a
  vendor/plugins/warbler/tasks/warbler.rake file. There's no need to
  "vendor" all of Warbler into your application anymore.

== 1.0.1

- Fix careless bug where Warbler doesn't work with JRuby 1.4

== 1.0

- Warbler hits 1.0! There are enough structural changes in Warbler
  that I feel it's time to roll the major version over to 1.0.
- Add support for Bundler. Detect Gemfiles, make sure gems are
  included in the war file and rewrite .bundle/environment.rb inside
  the war file.
- Warbler now uses RubyZip to create the war file in-place, without
  copying files to a tmp/war staging area. When run in JRuby it uses a
  Java ZipOutputStream for a modest performance boost.
- Add config option to allow override of gem_home (Daniel Harrington).
- Stop bundling jruby-rack, as promised.
- WARBLER-3: don't add from Rails config.gems if they are frozen
- WARBLER-7: Add config.webinf_files option with more support for
  custom web.xml files

== 0.9.14

- So, jruby-rack is bundled for one more release. 1.0 will not contain
  any jar files, I promise!
- Upgraded jruby-rack to 0.9.5.
- Unbundled jruby-complete jar in favor of new jruby-jars gem, which
  can be upgraded separately.
- Skip gems which have no loaded_from attribute set
  (this happened with the Authlogic gem on Edge Rails)
  (thanks Laszlo Bacsi)

== 0.9.13

- RailsConf 2009 edition.
- Only bundled JRuby and JRuby-Rack upgrades. Bug fixes will have to come in 0.9.14.
- This should also be the last release with bundled JRuby and JRuby-Rack.
- Upgrade to JRuby 1.3.0RC1 and JRuby-Rack 0.9.4. The latter allows 
  Rails 2.3 to work with Warbler.

== 0.9.12

- Allow framework auto-detection to be disabled. Set
  `Warbler.framework_detection = false' at the top of config/warble.rb
  or uncomment the line from a newly generated config.
- Add configuration option to set manifest file (thanks Tommy McGuire)
- Mitigate RubyGems 1.3 compatibility issue (thanks Jens Norrgrann)
- Add experimental `war:exploded` task. This allows you to deploy your
  application in an exploded mode, thus allowing continual development
  without re-warring and re-deploying. Feedback is appreciated if you
  try this feature; it may not work in all application servers and for
  applications other than Rails.
- Handle Rails gem dependencies better (thanks Laszlo Bacsi)
- Auto-detect Merb dependencies (Merb >= 1.0 only). Please give
  feedback if you try Warbler with a Merb 1.0 app.
- Ignore gem development dependencies
- Upgrade to JRuby 1.1.6 and JRuby-Rack 0.9.3

== 0.9.11

- Auto-detect Rails and Merb and configure appropriately
  - For Rails, set rails booter, determine max runtimes based on Rails.configuration.threadsafe!,
    add Rails gem, detect Rails version, set gems to be packaged based on
    Rails.configuration.gems if available
  - Rails gems only added if Rails application detected
  - For Merb, set merb booter automatically
- Auto-detect config.ru rackup script and pass it into config.webxml.rackup
- rails.env now commented by default in config/warble.rb and internally default
  the value to 'production'
- Default directories in config.dirs to only those that are found to be present
- Allow config.gems array to contain regexps and Gem::Dependency objects as well
 (assist from Jani Soila)
- Fix bug ensuring you can += and -= for config.gems
- Upgrade to JRuby 1.1.4 and JRuby-Rack 0.9.2
- add [] as a way to specify non-identifier keys, example: config.webxml['!@#$%^'] = 'haha'

== 0.9.10

- Upgraded to JRuby-Rack 0.9.1. Fixes JRUBY-2620, JRUBY-2594, JRUBY-2507.
- Now verified to work with Camping and Sinatra. See
  http://github.com/nicksieger/jruby-rack/tree/master/examples for examples
  of how to configure Warbler to package your Camping and Sinatra apps.
- Upgraded to JRuby 1.1.3.
- Log files are no longer packaged in the .war file.
- Fix #<Warbler::WebxmlOpenStruct ...> appearing in web.xml and document workarounds.
- Add config.autodeploy_dir that, when specified, will create the war there.

== 0.9.9

- Now shipping with JRuby-Rack 0.9!
- Upgrade to JRuby 1.1.1
- warble.rb and web.xml.erb have changed as a result of the change to JRuby-Rack -- we
  recommend comparing the new base copies with any existing configuration you have to
  make sure you pick up the differences.
- Config changes:
-- config.webxml.booter chooses what kind of application to use (:rails, :merb or plain :rack).
-- config.webxml.pool.* have been replaced by config.webxml.jruby.(min|max).runtimes
-- config.webxml.standalone and config.webxml.jruby_home no longer have any effect.

== 0.9.5

- Fix bug in plugin warbler.rake task file that would favor loading warbler from gems before the version
  installed as a plugin
- Upgrade to JRuby 1.1 final and Goldspike 1.6.1

== 0.9.4

- Update bundled JRuby to 1.1RC3 and Goldspike to 1.6.
- Fix inclusion of gems with platform-specific bits (e.g., Hpricot)

== 0.9.3

- Update bundled JRuby to 1.1RC2, and Goldspike to 1.5.
- The bundled JRuby and Goldspike now require JDK 5 or greater. If you wish to use JDK 1.4, use Warbler 0.9.2.

== 0.9.2

- Update bundled JRuby to version 1.0.3 and Goldspike 1.4.
- Add config.java_classes to allow you to copy loose Java classes into WEB-INF/classes.
- Make jar command a single command string so that jar creation doesn't fail (works around bug in JRuby 1.0.2)
- Use File.join to form staging directory, should produce the proper jar-command path in Windows

== 0.9.1

- Add rake >= 0.7.3 as a dependency in the gem specification.
- Add debug tasks: war:debug, war:debug:gems, war:debug:public, war:debug:app, war:debug:includes,
  war:debug:excludes, war:debug:java_libs gives you a breakdown of what Warbler expects to package.

== 0.9

- Birthday! Warbler is a gem to make a .war file out of a Rails project. The intent is to provide a
  minimal, flexible, ruby-like way to bundle up all of your application files for deployment to a
  Java application server.
- Bundled versions: goldspike-1.4-SNAPSHOT and jruby-complete-1.0.1
- Works as both a gem (rake application) or a plugin
