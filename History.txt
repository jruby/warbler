== 0.9.9

* Now shipping with JRuby-Rack 0.9!
* Upgrade to JRuby 1.1.1
* warble.rb and web.xml.erb have changed as a result of the change to JRuby-Rack -- we
  recommend comparing the new base copies with any existing configuration you have to
  make sure you pick up the differences.
* Config changes:
** config.webxml.booter chooses what kind of application to use (:rails, :merb or plain :rack).
** config.webxml.pool.* have been replaced by config.webxml.jruby.(min|max).runtimes
** config.webxml.standalone and config.webxml.jruby_home no longer have any effect.

  war:debug:excludes, war:debug:java_libs gives you a breakdown of what Warbler expects to package.

== 0.9

* Birthday! Warbler is a gem to make a .war file out of a Rails project. The intent is to provide a
  minimal, flexible, ruby-like way to bundle up all of your application files for deployment to a
  Java application server.
* Bundled versions: goldspike-1.4-SNAPSHOT and jruby-complete-1.0.1
* Works as both a gem (rake application) or a plugin
